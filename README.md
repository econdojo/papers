# Research Papers

My research agenda is organized around three areas: `macroeconomics`, `Bayesian statistics`, and `game theory`. One line of my current research develops time and frequency-domain approaches to dynamic equilibrium models of expectations formation. Another line develops Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimating large-scale structural models. These tools are applied to study monetary and fiscal policy, asset prices, and social networks. Recently, I like to train Bayesian neural nets regularized by economic theory. My previous research studies the evolution of cooperative and altruistic human behavior.
