# Research Papers

Grounded in first principles, my research develops algorithmic solutions for complex social systems at the intersection of `artificial intelligence`, `economics`, and `statistics`. One line of my research develops time-domain and frequency-domain approaches to dynamic equilibrium models with strategic agents. Another line develops Bayesian methods for estimating large-scale structural models. These tools are applied to study economic policy, asset prices, and social networks. Recently, I like to train neural nets regularized by economic theory. My previous research studies the evolution of cooperative and altruistic human behavior.
